  "summary": "Both REQ-22 and REQ-23 appear to be implemented in the diff. REQ-22 is addressed in AdminLoginForm.tsx with the password changed to 'namita6565' and the visible password hint removed. REQ-23 is addressed via useQueries.ts (useAddProduct calling actor.createProduct) and backend/main.mo (createProduct function defined). One hallucinated feature was identified: a show/hide password toggle not requested in the spec.",

      "reason": "The build request does not mention adding a show/hide password toggle to the AdminLoginForm. REQ-22 only requires removing the visible password hint and changing the password — no toggle was requested.",
